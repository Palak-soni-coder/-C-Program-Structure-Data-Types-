Data Types in C++
In this program, I explored some of the basic data types in C++ like int, float, double, char, string, and bool. The main aim was to understand how different types of data are stored in memory and how much space each type occupies.

Data Types Used
Integer (int): Used to store whole numbers. It usually takes 4 bytes of memory.

Float (float): Used to store decimal numbers with single precision. It also typically takes 4 bytes.

Double (double): Similar to float but with double precision (more accurate), and it takes 8 bytes.

Character (char): Stores a single character like 'A' or 'z'. It only uses 1 byte.

String (string): Stores a sequence of characters (like words). Its size in memory can vary depending on implementation, but the variable itself usually occupies more space as it internally uses dynamic memory.

Boolean (bool): Stores either true or false, but still takes 1 byte.

Concepts
The sizeof() operator in C++ tells us how much memory (in bytes) a particular data type or variable takes.

Even though some values may look small, the memory they take can be larger due to how the computer stores them.

Every data type is different, and it’s important to choose the right one based on what we need (like accuracy, memory, etc.).

I also understood how cin and cout work for taking input and showing output in C++.

A bool still takes 1 byte even though it only stores 0 or 1.

Double is more accurate but uses more memory than float.

String is more complex internally — it’s not just a collection of characters but also involves memory management.
